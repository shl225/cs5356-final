As between the Parties, to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to <span class="s3">Section 5(e)</span>: (A) Customer owns all Input provided by Customer; and (B) subject to Customer’s compliance with these Terms, DataPowered AI assigns to Customer its right, title and interest in and to the Output generated by Customer’s Input.

</div>
<p class="p3">Customer is solely responsible for its use of downloaded Fine-Tuned Models. DataPowered AI will not provide access to or share any of Customer’s Fine-Tuned Models with any of DataPowered AI’s other customers.</p>
<div style="padding-left: 20px;">

From time-to-time Customer or its employees, contractors, representatives may provide DataPowered AI with suggestions, comments, feedback or the like with regard to the Services (collectively, “<b>Feedback</b>”). Customer hereby grants DataPowered AI a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free and fully-paid up license to use and exploit all Feedback in connection with DataPowered AI’s business purposes, including, without limitation, the testing, development, maintenance and improvement of the Services. For clarity, Feedback is not considered Confidential Information.</p>
<p><span class="s3">(i)&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third-Party Services</span></span>. Certain features and functionalities within the Services may allow Customer and its Authorized Users to interface or interact with, access and/or use compatible third-party services, products, technology and content (collectively, “<b>Third-Party Services</b>”). DataPowered AI does not provide any aspect of the Third-Party Services and is not responsible for any compatibility issues, errors or bugs in the Services or Third-Party Services caused in whole or in part by the Third-Party Services or any update or upgrade thereto. Customer is solely responsible for maintaining the Third-Party Services and obtaining any associated licenses and consents necessary for Customer to use the Third-Party Services in connection with the Services.</p>
<p><b style="margin-left: -20px;">6. SUBSCRIPTIONS AND FREE TIER</b>. DataPowered AI requires payment of a fee for use of the Services (or certain portions thereof), as set forth at <a href="https://datapowered.ai/pricing"><span class="s1">https://datapowered.ai/pricing</span></a> (“<b>Fees</b> <b>Webpage</b>”) and you agree to pay such fees. You have the option of purchasing a subscription (“<b>Subscription</b>”) or electing the free subscription tier (“<b>Free Tier</b>”) for such use, as further described on the Fees Webpage.</p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 20px; padding-top: 20px;">
<p>(a)<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b> General</b></span>. When you purchase a Subscription (each, a “<b>Transaction</b>”), you expressly authorize DataPowered AI’s (or DataPowered AI’s third-party payment processor) to charge you for such Transaction. DataPowered AI may ask you to supply additional information relevant to your Transaction, including your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card and your email and postal addresses for billing and notification (such information, “<b>Payment Information</b>”). You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information. When you initiate a Transaction, you authorize DataPowered AI to provide your Payment Information to third parties so DataPowered AI can complete your Transaction and to charge your payment method for the type of Transaction you have selected (plus any applicable taxes and other charges). You may need to provide additional information to verify your identity before completing your Transaction (such information is included within the definition of Payment Information). By initiating a Transaction, you agree to the pricing, payment and billing policies applicable to such fees and charges, as posted or otherwise communicated to you. All payments for Transactions are non-refundable and non-transferable except as expressly provided in these Terms. All fees and applicable taxes, if any, are payable in United States dollars.</p>
<p>(b) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Subscriptions</b></span>. If you purchase a Subscription, you will be charged the monthly Subscription fee, plus any applicable taxes, and other charges (“<b>Subscription Fee</b>”), at the beginning of your Subscription and each month thereafter, at the then-current Subscription Fee. BY PURCHASING A SUBSCRIPTION, YOU AUTHORIZE DATAPOWERED AI TO INITIATE RECURRING NON-REFUNDABLE PAYMENTS AS SET FORTH BELOW. If you purchase a Subscription, DataPowered AI (or DataPowered AI’s third-party payment processor) will charge you on that day for the pro-rata amount of days left in the month, and thereafter automatically charge you on the first day of each month of your Subscription, using the Payment Information you have provided until you cancel your Subscription. Subject to applicable law, before your Subscription term ends, or otherwise in accordance with applicable law, DataPowered AI will send you a reminder with the then-current Subscription Fee. By agreeing to these Terms and electing to purchase a Subscription, you acknowledge that your Subscription has recurring payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of your Subscription by you or DataPowered AI. Your Subscription continues until cancelled by you or DataPowered AI terminates your access to or use of the Services or Subscription in accordance with these Terms.</p>
<p>(c) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Payments and Excess Usage</b></span>. The monthly Subscription Fee is for access to a predetermined number of monthly usage credits (“<b>Credits</b>”) as set forth on the Fees Webpage, which are consumed at certain rates based on a variety of criteria (e.g., image size). The Credits do not rollover, and so the monthly allocation of Credits can be used only in that month. If Customer’s usage exceeds its allotted Credits in an applicable month, such excess usage will be subject to additional fees at DataPowered AI’s then-current rates for excess usage as set forth on the Fees Webpage. Such fees for exceeding the allotted allocation of Credits will be charged to Customer in arrears on the first day of the month following such excess usage. If Customer fails to make any payment when due, late charges will accrue at the rate of 1.5% per month or, if lower, the highest rate permitted by applicable law and DataPowered AI may suspend Services until all payments are made in full. Customer will reimburse DataPowered AI for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) in collecting any late payments or interest.</p>
<p>(d) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Cancelling Subscription</b></span>. YOUR PURCHASE IS FINAL AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CANCEL THE PURCHASE AND/OR RECEIVE A REFUND OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FEE AT ANY TIME. But if something unexpected happens in the course of completing a Transaction, DataPowered AI reserves the right to cancel your Transaction for any reason; if DataPowered AI cancels your Transaction DataPowered AI will refund any payment you have already remitted to DataPowered AI for such Transaction. Without limiting the foregoing, you may cancel your Subscription at any time, but please note that such cancellation will be effective at the end of the then-current Subscription period. YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE PAID FOR THE THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AT THE TIME OF CANCELLATION. To cancel the autorenewal of your subscription, you can opt to cancel from within the Platform. You will be responsible for all Subscription Fees (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) incurred for the then-current Subscription period. If you cancel, your right to use the Services will continue until the end of your then current Subscription period and will then terminate without further charges.</p>

For clarity, the Services and the Documentation will be deemed Confidential Information of DataPowered AI. The Receiving Party will not use or disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party except as necessary to perform its obligations or exercise its rights under these Terms; provided that DataPowered AI may use and modify Confidential Information of Customer in deidentified form for purposes of developing and deriving Aggregate Data. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party only: (i) to those of its employees, contractors, agents and advisors who have a bona fide need to know such Confidential Information to perform under these Terms and who are bound by written agreements with use and nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective of the Confidential Information as those set forth in these Terms, or (ii) as such disclosure may be required by the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency or other governmental body, subject to the Receiving Party providing to the Disclosing Party reasonable written notice to allow the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order or otherwise contest the disclosure.</p>
